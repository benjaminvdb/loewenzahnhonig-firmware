# Smoodge Delay

Stereo Clockable Delay for the wgd modular l√∂wenzahnhonig Daisy Seed Eurorack module.
Delay times up to 16 seconds are supported and it has no noticeable minimum delay time - so go wild!

In addition to behaving like a regular stereo delay effect, there is an adjustable spatial effect called smoodge.
At low levels (1-50%) smoodge will create a wider stereo field using psychoacoustic techniques.
At higher levels (50-100%) the psychoacoustic techniques increase in intensity, plus other effects are introduced such as wow and flutter, tape saturation and a stereo tremelo effect that varies over time if you are clocking the module.
The smoodge effect is most noticeable when both the Wet and Feedback controls move towards higher ranges.

If you are using a mono source this effect works best if InL is normalled to InR in hardware.

## Description

### Controls:

| Control | Function        |
|---------|-----------------|
| P1      | Delay Feedback (Repeats)      |
| P2      | Dry/Wet      |
| P3      | Delay Time (See Usage below)      |
| P4      | Smoodge (see notes above)      |
| CV1     | Input Clock      |
| CV2     | Delay Feedback (Repeats) Summed with P1     |

### Usage

Start by plugging in a stereo sound source (or mono into the L input if you have normalled your R-input to the L-input), then connect the left and right outputs to a mixer.

You might find it easier to dial in the sound you want using the following process:

1. Set the feedback to min
2. Set the Dry/Wet to 50%
3. Set the Smoodge to min
4. Set the Delay Time to 50%
5. Start your sound source
6. Adjust the Delay Time to something that you like
7. Gradually increase the feedback until it sounds good to you
8. Gradually increase the Smoodge
9. Remember these settings, then go wild with the controls and see what happens!

The Delay Feedback and Dry/Wet controls act as you would expect:
- Delay Feedback: At min will produce one repeat/echo. At max it will feedback infinitely - you can even remove your sound source once it is looping if you like!
- Dry/Wet; At min the output is 100% dry. At max the output is 100% wet.

#### Delay Time

The Delay Time control will change the delay time as a division or multiplication of the delay time set by the input clock.
Note, if you turn on the module without giving it a clock the default delay time is 1 second.
If you imagine the knob goes from 0 to 10, below you will find the divisions/multiplications that corespond to each number on the dial.

- 0: /8
- 1: /4
- 2: /3 (half-note triplets)
- 3: /2
- 4: /1.5 (whole note triplets)
- 5: /1 or x1 whichever sounds better to you
- 6: x2
- 7: x3
- 8: x4
- 9: x5
- 10: x8

If for example you send in clocks which are 1 second apart, setting the Delay Time knob in the centre would produce echos every second, at min it would produce an echo every 1/8th of a second and at max it would produce an echo every 8 seconds.
