### Patching ideas:

#### Synth Ambience

- Feedback: 90%
- Wet/Dry: 50%
- Tone: 30%
- Splooge: 60%

Tweak the Splooge to taste. Low is more subdued, while a high value will sound etheral and spacey.

#### Roomy - good for Drums

- Feedback: 50%
- Wet/Dry: 40%
- Tone: 50%
- Splooge: 5%

Tweaking Feedback will adjust the size of the room. Tweaking Tone will change the materials in the room.
Tweaking Spooge will add echos.

#### Warm - good for stringed instruments

- Feedback: 75%
- Wet/Dry: 50%
- Tone: 40%
- Splooge: 0%

This is a good starting point to then tweak as you like.
The idea with this one is to add some low to medium frequency body to sounds, rather than overwhelming it with reverb.
